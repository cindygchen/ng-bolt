/**
 * @ngdoc module
 * @name blt_config
 * @module blt_config
 * @sortorder 2
 *
 * @description
 * The `blt_config` module is generated automatically during the application gulp
 * build from the `build.json` config file and injected into ngBoltJS's core module.
 * These settings define ngBoltJS's configuration and are accessible in your
 * application from the `config` constant.
 *
 * The properties in the `build.json` file can be overriden by matching properties
 * in a `build` object in your {@link blt_appProfile application's profile}.
 * Because you can have multiple profiles, you can have different configurations
 * for each profile. This is useful when wanting to override development settings
 * when deploying to a production environment.
 *
 * The properties exposed in the build configuration are listed below.
 *

 * ## Libraries

The `dest` directory is a directory, relative to the root of your build output directory where the asset(s) defined in the `src` property will be copied. |

 * ## Components
